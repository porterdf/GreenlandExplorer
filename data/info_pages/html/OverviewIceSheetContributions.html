<h3>Overview</h3> 
<p>
There are two masses of ice left on Earth today that are large enough to be called ice sheets. Ice sheets are sections of ice on land greater than 50,000 kilometers (20,000 miles)  
in size. The two ice sheets represent the large potential for future sea level rise. With enough water to raise sea level an incredible 66 meters (~220 ft) 
the ice sheets are an important focus of climate science research. To date the ice sheets have been contributing only a small amount to the annual 
sea level increases with thermal expansion of the warming ocean contributing about 50% and glacier melt contributing 30% and the two ice sheets 20%. Ice that is already 
floating in the ocean will not affect sea level when it melts. Sea ice is an example of this floating ice.

<h2>Greenland Ice Sheet</h2>
<p>
Greenland, the largest island on Earth, is almost entirely covered by ice. 
In the center the ice is more than 3 km (2 miles) thick with enough weight to push down the land below. The result is that Greenland 
is shaped something like a bowl with the center lying below sea level. Fieldwork measurements and data collected from 
airplanes and satellites show that Greenland is losing ice mass. Around the edges of the ice sheet, 
warmer air and water temperatures are melting and thinning the ice adding fresh water to the ocean. If all of the 
Greenland's ice sheet were to melt, global sea-level would go up by about 6-7m (about 20 feet).
</p>

<h2>Antarctic Ice Sheet</h2>
<p>
Antarctica will dwarf the impact of Greenland. This remote southern continent plays a key role in Earth's climate and ocean systems. 
Like Greenland, Antarctica is almost entirely masked with ice but its sheer size makes all the difference. 
Covering a surface area greater than the size of the US and Mexico combined, the Antarctic ice sheet in places is 
greater than 4000m (2.5 miles) thick. So much fresh water is locked into the Antarctic ice sheet that if it 
were all to melt, global average sea-level would rise by a barely-comprehensible 60m (200 feet). 
Along the edge of West Antarctica, ice surface elevation - a fundamental parameter that helps scientists assess the stability of the ice sheet - 
is decreasing at rates as much as half a meter per year and is destabilizing parts of the ice sheet far inland from the coast.
