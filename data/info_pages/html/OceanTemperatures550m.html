<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
The world's ocean plays a central role in controlling Earth's temperature as it circulates warm and cool water throughout the world.
The ocean covers ~70% of the world surface and absorbs and stores energy from the sun. As the world has been warming, the ocean has been absorbing much of the heat.
The size and volume of the world's ocean, and the high heat capacity of water mean that the ocean has dominated the increase in energy
stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated since 1971. The Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica,
and the <a href="#ACC" data-rel="popup"> Antarctic Circumpolar Current</a>, play a critical role in climate. Since 2006, 60-90% of the change in global ocean heat content from global warming is centered
in the Southern Ocean.

<p>
<b> Why study the ocean?</b> The world's ocean covers approximately 70% of the surface area of our planet,
with its dark coloring absorbing the sun's heat energy. While different materials absorb heat at different rates, water has a very high <a href="#heat" data-rel="popup"> specific heat</a>. therefore the amount of heat needed to
raise the temperature of water by 1 degree C is several times higher than to raise the temperature of the same mass of granite.
The result of this high specific heat is that the temperature of the land will generally warm more quickly than that of the ocean. Although
the ocean is slower to warm, it stores its heat energy.

</div>

<p>
<b> What is the climate role of the ocean?</b> The trapping of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased the amount of heat being absorbed on Earth and the ocean has
dominated the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated since 1971.
About two-thirds of the heat energy added to the ocean has been absorbed slowly in the upper 700m (2300 ft) of the ocean water column. Although warming in the ocean extends well
below the this depth, the uppermost section exhibits the most noticeable temperature increase. Since the early 1990s, the full depth ocean heat gain is 0.57 to 0.81 watts per square meter.
</p>

<p>
<b> Are the ocean basins all responding the same?</b> The world's ocean is not uniform and different sections are adjusting in different ways. The five ocean basins, Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Antarctic and Arctic Oceans
all have different drivers and inputs affecting their responses. The Atlantic Ocean shows an overall warming trend, but the other oceans have shown greater variability in their response to
climate change. Specific areas of ocean warming around the globe include waters off the eastern coasts of Greenland and Japan, and in the Arctic Ocean
near Siberia where averaged temperatures have increased between 1-2 degrees Celsius. In contrast, the upper several hundred meters of parts of the Arctic Ocean and
much of the Southern Ocean south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are characterised by slight decreases in temperature.
In these polar regions, <a href="#melt" data-rel="popup"> glacial meltwater</a> may be causing some of the cooling in the upper meters of the ocean. Glacial melt is fresh and so would form a layer
sitting above the saltier more dense ocean water below. This glacier melt layer would affecting ocean surface temperatures.

<p>
<b> What is the role of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current?</b> The southern ocean surrounding Antarctica, plays a critical role in
climate as it has no land masses to block its massive circumpolar current.
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is the largest current on Earth, moving 120 times more water than all the rivers on the world combined.
The current is fast flowing moving 26 billion gallons/second, and deep reaching as it rapidly swirls around the bottom of the globe, linking together water from
the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian oceans. Since 2006, 60-90% of the global ocean heat content change from global warming is centered
in the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is warming at varying rates with the top 770-1000 meters warming at rates of 0.1-0.2 degrees Celsius/decade
north of and within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Surface water areas closer to the Antarctic continent are slightly cooling, which may be a result of
glacial melt collecting at the surface. Deep water around Antarctica is
warming at a rate of 0.05 degrees Celsius/decade due to the formation of dense bottom water on the continental shelves.

<p>
<b> What about Sea Level Rise?</b> As the ocean warms, the water expands, contributing to sea level rise. Small changes in ocean temperature can have a large effect on sea-level
since water expands as it warms through a process called <a href="#thermal" data-rel="popup">thermal expansion</a>. Since the 1960s, thermal expansion has been contributing between half to two-thirds of the total estimated rise in global
sea-level.

<p>
<b>How was this data collected?</b> Data on ocean temperatures has been collected for decades using different shipboard measurements collected while a ship is underway and dropping buoys into
the ocean to collect data over a season or more. More recently satellites have been collecting ocean surface temperature data, but satellites can
not collect temperatures deep down in the ocean. The International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration projects have been collecting ocean temperature data using
a range of different techniques including drilling <a href="#bore" data-rel="popup">boreholes </a>in the ice shelf and dropping instruments down into the water below, placing probes on seals
who dive down in the ocean collecting temperature data, using a submarine style robot, and a diving glider.

<b>How can we use the app?</b> The data in the app is collected at 550 meters (1800 ft) of depth to avoid some of the surface glacial melt temperatures. We recommend you start viewing this map by zooming out
to see how the water around Antarctica appears in colored bands of concentric circles.
Furthest away from the continent you will see the red/orange color band showing the distinctive warming. As you move in closer you will see some of the larger ice shelves
are brodered in deep blue colors represent cooler ocean temperatures. Around the Thwaites Glacier you will see green coloring. Click on the map to check on the different
temperatures. Recall that salt water doesn't freeze at the same temperature as freshwater. The temperatures bordering the Thwaites Glacier are
warm enough to cause increasing melt under the ice shelf, what effect might this have on Thwaites glacier? This data starts at 550 meters (1800 ft), what do you think would be the difference
in temperature if we were to sample at the surface?
