<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
An individual's fingerprints are known as 'unique identifiers', often linked to a crime scene investigation. 
Detectives uncover a fingerprint, providing a link to a specific individual, and the fingerprint is used as evidence linking back to the person at fault in a crime.
Scientists, like detectives, examine evidence and review the data to link the <i>fingerprint</i> of an action to a specific source. 
In the case of ice sheets, scientists have proposed that if there were rapid ice melt of the Greenland and Antarctica <a href="#sheet" data-rel="popup">ice sheets</a> each would have a unique geographic impact on sea level change. 
This geographic impact, or pattern of response, has been nicknamed a <i>fingerprint</i> because of its distinct link to the source. 
The maps displayed in the app are created to model the fingerprint or impact of sea level change given the rapid melt of each ice sheet.

<p>
<b> Why do ice sheets pull the ocean water towards them?</b> Antarctica and Greenland are covered in thick deep ice (see the ice thickness map in this section of the app). Both land areas are primarily covered by ice, with Antarctic ice extending almost 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles) 
and Greenlandâ€™s ice about 1.7 million square kilometers (656,000 square miles). Adding to the ice extent are ice thicknesses of ~4 kms of ice near the center of Antarctica and ~ 2 kms of ice at the center of Greenland. 
This results in vast expanses of ice stacked up like mountains. Ice masses of this size provide significant gravitational attraction and pull on the surrounding ocean water. 
This gravitational attraction from the ice has caused the ocean around Greenland and Antarctica to pile up around their coastlines resulting in local sea levels that are much higher than if there were no ice present.
</p>
<p>
<b> How do we know about past sea level?</b> The geologic record contains ancient sea markers left on the landscape from past warming, clues that can be used to piece together the areas of impact from the warming ice sheets during the warm <a href="#inter" data-rel="popup">interglacials</a>.
They are intersted in what the impact on sea level will be around the world as the ice sheets accelerate in their melting, losing large amounts of ice mass. 
</p>
<div data-role="popup" id="inter">
<p>More temperate warm periods that fall between icy glacial time periods.</p>
</div>
<p>
<b> How will water from the ice sheets affect sea level in different places?</b> The melting ice will increase the water volume in the global ocean, but evidence from the past shows that the additional melt water will not increase sea level evenly around the world. 
Predicted future impacts have been developed working with clues from past sea level change and using different models of the Earth (e.g. elastic, rigid, compressible and non-compressible, rotating). 
Although the ice melt model results have some small variance in both the amount of sea level fall close to where there is ice loss, and how far this fall extends, called a <a href="#near" data-rel="popup">'near field effect'</a>, 
overall they are strongly consistent in the geographic redistribution of ocean water in the a <a href="#far" data-rel="popup">'far field"</a> away from the polar regions.  The models predict that areas within ~2000 to 2500 km of Greenland and Antarctica will see the water relax away from the land and sea level 
will drop as the gravitational attraction weakens with ice loss. Greenland ice sheet loss would disproportionately raise sea level in South America, 
while West Antarctica ice sheet loss (including Thwaites Glacier) would disproportionately affect the North Atlantic and Pacific Coastal regions.

<b> What can we learn from the app?</b> Explore the two maps. They represent the impact from the loss of the northern ice sheet (Greenland), and the southern ice sheet (Antarctica). 
Blue colors represent sea level drop caused by rapid ice loss from the ice sheet shown. 
The dark red areas show where sea level will rise due to the redistribution of the ocean water currently attracted to each ice sheet. Think about where you live, 
what will the impact be from ice loss in Greenland? What about from Antarctica? Where is the biggest effect from ice loss of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets?

Note that the computations, numerical models and boundary conditions used in the model calculations are much more complex than what is described here.
