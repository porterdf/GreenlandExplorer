<h2>What about the polar regions?</h2>
<p> Users might question why an entire section of this app is devoted to the remote polar regions. 
The answer lies in the sea level rise potential that is tied up in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, 
and the neighboring high latitude glaciers. In this section you will see a range of measurements collected by different methods, 
many from different satellites. Each of these independent measures points to warming and melting of ice in the polar regions. 
In prior warm periods in Earth's history, ice melt from the polar regions has 
contributed many meters of sea level rise. The record left on the Earth suggests that sea level rise in warm periods is a much 
more rapid process than the creation of ice during a cold period. Studying the polar regions can help us understand 
the timing and extent of this process. 
</p>

<h3>Greenland ice sheet thickness</h3>
<p>The largest island in the world, Greenland, lies in the cold Arctic region of the far 
North Atlantic, and is covered by an enormous sheet of ice. At its thickest the ice is more 
than 3,300 m deep (more than 10,000 feet) and its weight is enough that it has pushed down on, and deformed, the land beneath it. 
If all of the Greenland ice sheet were to melt global sea-level would rise by more than 
7m (23 feet), potentially displacing hundred of millions of people from coastal towns and cities.
</p>

<h3>A look under the Greenland ice sheet</h3>
<p>Tools like ice-penetrating radar and gravity reveal the surprising landscape 
beneath the Greenland ice sheet. Much of the land is pushed below sea-level by the shear weight 
of ice - land that will slowly rebound if the ice sheet melts. A canyon, the longest on our 
planet, is carved from the north down into the center of the land, discovered under the ice. 
Thought to have been carved by liquid water not ice, today it brings warmed ocean water under the ice sheet, 
encouraging faster movement of ice towards the sea. Similarly, deep glacially-eroded fjords cut through large mountains that ring 
the island and hasten the flow of ice to the sea.
</p>


<h3>Annual surface melt of the Greenland ice sheet</h3>
<p>Unlike Antarctica where the surface of the vast ice sheet remains frozen year-round, 
the Greenland ice sheet is suffering an increasing amount of surface melting each 
summer. When the surface of the ice sheet melts, its reflectivity decreases, more energy 
from the sun is absorbed by the liquid water, and even more of the ice surface melts - 
a process known as a 'positive feedback'. As global air temperatures steadily increase, 
warmer air over Greenland adds to the melting of the ice sheet surface, adding to sea level rise. 
</p>


<h3>Velocity of the Greenland ice sheet</h3>
<p>Gravity tends to make things move down slope and ice is no exception. The Greenland 
ice sheet flows downhill under its weight, slowly where the slope is gentle but faster 
where the surface steepens. Although friction at the base of the ice where it drags on the ground below tends to slow the motion, 
any small pooling of water at the base (basal meltwater) reduces that frictional drag, allowing the ice to flow more quickly. 
In Greenland, glacial discharge into the sea has sped up over the past decade, faster than
the rate at which snow accumulates on the ice sheet. The net loss of ice to the ocean is 
causing a rise in global sea-level. With a potential 7m (23 feet) of sea-level rise 
expected if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt, scientists carefully monitor 
Greenland's ice flow. Ice in some outlet glaciers flows at tens of meters per day 
towards the ocean!
</p>


<h3>Elevation change of the Greenland ice sheet</h3>
<p>Overall Greenland is losing ice mass, with the melting from this ice sheet contributing to global sea-level rise. Measuring 
the elevation across the ice sheet helps us understand how the ice sheet responds 
to a warming climate and allows us to estimate the volume of ice being lost to the ocean. Satellites and
a unique NASA coordinated airborne mission (Ice Bridge) have collected elevation measurements from the air using 
lidar, a type of laser. Although snowfall has increased the surface elevation of the ice sheet in a few of Greenland's 
interior regions, this is outweighed by the melt along the edges of the ice sheet where Greenland is losing elevation.

<h3>A look under the Antarctic ice sheet</h3>
<p>The Antarctic ice sheet is massive, storing more than 70% of all of the world's fresh water. In parts of East Antartica the ice measures 
4,000m (13,000 feet) in thickness, its vast weight pushing down the underlying crust. 
West Antarctica is an ice-covered archipelago with much of the ice already resting on the ocean floor. 
Measurement techniques like ice-penetrating radar and gravity, provide data that reveal the 
varied landscape beneath the ice sheet, including large mountain ranges, expansive under-ice lakes of fresh liquid water, and deep ice-carved valleys. 
Antarctica is about 7 times larger than Greenland, and if the ice were all to melt, global sea-level would rise 60m (200 feet) transforming 
the shape of the world's land masses. 
</p>


<h3>Antarctic ice sheet thickness</h3>
<p>For more than 34 million years ice has been present in Antarctica. Yet even with today's 
modern technology and logistical capabilities, scientific study there is made difficult 
because of the continent's remoteness, vast size, and harsh environment. Understanding the 
thickness of the ice sheet is a necessary parameter for assessing the 
impact of climate change both in the south polar region and globally. Ice-penetrating 
radar and seismology are two cutting-edge techniques that help us measure the ice 
thickness. In West Antarctica, much of the ice already rests in the ocean reducing the overall impact on 
sea level from future melting. However, on the other side of the Transantarctic Mountains, the East Antarctic ice sheet 
lies completely on land and is so thick - up to 4 km (13,000 feet) - that its weight depresses the land 
beneath. If all of the East Antarctic ice sheet were to melt, global sea-level would increase 
by 55m (180 feet).
</p>


<h3>Surface elevation change of the Antarctic ice sheet</h3>
<p>Melting of the Antarctic ice sheet will have significant impact upon global sea-level 
rise so scientists closely monitor changes in its volume. One vital parameter needed to 
calculate ice volume is the surface elevation of the ice sheet. Detailed observations 
show that the West Antarctic ice sheet is currently thinning and losing mass. In places, 
the rate of thinning is as much as 50 cm (1.5 feet) per year as fast-flowing ice drains 
into the Amundsen Sea. Where ice flows off the land into the ocean it floats, creating ice shelves that 
act like barricades and slow the flow of ice off the continent. But, as climate change warms 
the temperature in the global ocean water the contact weakens the underside 
of floating ice shelves making them unstable and susceptible to collapse. Lacking 
the 'backstop action' of ice shelves the Antarctic ice sheet is expected to flow faster and thin more 
rapidly, adding water to the global ocean and raising sea-level.
</p>


<h3>Velocity of the Antarctic ice sheet</h3>
<p>Glacial ice is in constant motion and being able to measure its velocity allows us to 
gauge changes in its behavior. Using multiple years of satellite data, we find that ice 
near the summit of the Antarctic ice sheet lies almost flat and moves slowly. However,
around the coast, fast-moving flows are found in ice streams and ice shelves, with ice 
being delivered to the oceans in some regions at rates of 3,000m (10,000 feet) per year. With tens of 
meters of global sea-level rise stored in the West and East Antarctic ice sheets, monitoring 
their flow is crucial to understanding the impact of climate change upon our planet.
