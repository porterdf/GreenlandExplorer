<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Sea level is affected by many parts of the climate system. The warming of the oceans has a direct effect 
through thermal expansion of water (warmer water expands) causing it to take up more space. Our warming atmosphere is melting more snow and ice which we can 
see in the contributions of melting ice towards sea level rise. Finally we look at the role of post-glacial or 'isostatic rebound' defined as sections of 
land once buried under large amounts of ice slowly rise back up as the weight of the ice is removed. </p>

<h2>What is the role of ocean temperature?</h2>
<p> The ocean plays a major role in Earth's climate system, absorbing heat as the world has been warming. Users can click down through different ocean depths to see 
temperatures and see how the ocean is storing heat content. As the ocean warms it expands causing sea level to rise, currently accounting for about half of 
all sea level rise. 
</p>


<h2>What is the role of the atmosphere?</h2>
<p> The Earth's atmosphere has been steadily warming, with the ten warmest recorded temperatures occurring since 1998. 
However, the atmosphere has warmed unevenly with the Arctic temperatures increasing at almost twice the rate as mid latitudes. 
A warming atmosphere causes more melt of glaciers and Arctic ice causing sea level to rise. 
</p>


<h2>What about melting of ice and smow?</h2>
<p> Melting from the world's mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets accounts for about half of the sea level rise around the world. However, the 
potential in the ice sheets is significant with over 66 meters (217 ft.) of sea level rise tied up in the ice sheets alone. 
</p>


<h2>What about post glacial rebound?</h2>
<p> The loading and unloading of the ice sheets has a long term effect on local global sea level. Ice, where it is stacked on the land, 
causes the land to sink under its weight. As the ice melts it can take thousands of years for the land to respond rising back up. This has 
effects on local sea level both in sections of land under the ice sheet, and in areas further away that have been popped up as other sections settle. Another name 
for this process is called isostatic rebound.
