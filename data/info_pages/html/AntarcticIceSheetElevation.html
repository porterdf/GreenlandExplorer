<h4>Summary</h4> 
</p>
<p>
<a href="#sheet" data-rel="popup">Ice sheet</a> height, or elevation, is a combined measure of the land below and ice above. Elevation is important when considering ice susceptibility to climate change. Higher 
elevations, like those in East Antarctica, often show little to no warming while many lower elevations, like areas of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica, show noticeable warming. 
Elevation is also used to measure changes in ice surface through time. The ice surface in Thwaites Glacier and neighboring Pine Island Glacier has been dropping in elevation as they lose ice. 
The total amount of ice, where it has accumulated, how it changed in past climate events, and how it is changing today are all measurements used to develop models for future predictions of the ice sheet.

<b> Why is Antarctica covered in thick ice?</b> The Earth's tilted rotation, and Antarctica's position away from the equator, mean that for much of the year Antarctica receives significantly less heat and energy from the sun than areas in the mid-latitudes nearer the equator. 
Approximately 35-40 million years ago Drake's Passage opened separating Antarctica from South America and causing a change in ocean and atmospheric circulation around Antarctica. This separation 
has kept the continent mainly isolated from the rest of the world. The physical changes, the establishment of the strong circular currents in the Southern Ocean and the strong air patterns in the Polar Front, 
resulted in somewhat of a temperature isolation of Antarctica. Snow collects and presses into permanent ice, and through time has formed the very thick and old ice sheet now covering Antarctica. 
Overall, the land mass is 97% covered with 27 million km3 of ice.  
</p>

<p>
<b> Is all of Antarctica the same?</b> Antarctica is made up of two very different land masses. East Antarctica, is a much older, denser and larger section of land and ice, and  
makes up ~66% of the continent. The average elevation of East Antarctica is 2 kms (1.2 miles), although some areas reach up to 4 kms (2.5 miles).
Although some sections of East Antarctica are below sea level, much of it sits up high with large amounts of ice stacked on the land. If all the ice on East Antarctica moved into the ocean, sea level would rise close to 55 meters (180 ft). 
However, currently this high frozen desert of Antarctica is undergoing limited ice loss. West Antarctica is an ice covered series of islands, or <a href="#arch" data-rel="popup">archipelago</a>, with elevations measuring up to 2500 meters (1.5 miles) thick at its highest, but mostly measuring less than 2000 meters of elevation. 
This part of the continent is much lower in elevation and is undergoing measurable ice loss with resulting elevation losses. This is especially true in the region of the Amundsen Sea which includes glaciers like Thwaites and Pine Island.
To better understand this region, you can go to the section of the app titled 'Why is Thwaites Vulnerable' and select the map 'Look under the Antarctic ice sheet'. This map shows Antarctica without the ice cover, 
emphasizing how much of West Antarctica is below sea level, with much of the ice in this area already resting in the ocean. If the entire West Antarctic ice sheet were to melt the contribution to sea level would be close to 6 meters (20 ft.). 
Thwaites glacier is critical in West Antarctic sea level rise contributions with direct contributions of 65 cm (2 ft.) of sea level rise. However, its collapse could release ice stacked behind it, which overall would cause 3 meters (10 ft.) of sea level rise.

<b> How was the data collected?</b> Ice elevation is a combined measure from which Ice thickness is calculated by using radar to find the base of the ice on the underlying topography, 
and then measuring the height of the ice in the ice sheet above that point. 
Knowing the ice elevation is a 'boundary condition', or a required element, for developing models of how we expect the ice sheet to behave with changes in climate. 
The total amount of ice in the ice sheet, and where it has accumulated over time, are both important in understanding potential future changes and sea level impacts of the ice sheet. 
</p>

<p>
Measurements of ice thickness in the app are collected from the Radarsat Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) and include high-resolution radarsat data and topographic data 
from a number of sources to get full coverage of the area. Data for this map has been collected from the 1940s to present, most of it from 1980 forward. Radar measures total ice thickness from the surface to 
the base of the ice, as well as information on the different internal layers of ice thickness. Radar operates by sending pulses of radio waves and measuring and timing the delay between sending and receiving a pulse through the ice.
The size and remoteness of Antarctica makes data collection challenging. Satellite data combined with airborne data continues to improve our understanding of ice thickness in Antarctica. 
</p>

<p>
<b> What can we learn from the app?</b> Ice sheet height or elevation, and overall ice thickness, are both important measurements in understanding present changes in the ice sheet and in predicting future change. 
The map in the app divides the ice into contours of ice thickness. Zoom out to get a better look at the full continent. Clicking on each contour brings up the thickness of the ice in meters. 
Although Antarctica is one continent, it is separated into West and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains. In the app, you can 
see the separation in the narrowing between the peninsula shape of West Antarctica, and the larger more oval shaped land mass of East Antarctica. Click through the map. How does East Antarctic 
elevation differ from West Antarctic elevation? Why do you think West Antarctica is more vulnerable to climate change? What is the highest elevation in the Thwaites Glacier catchment area? Why 
do you think Thwaites glacier is important for us to be studying?
