<h4>Summary</h4>
</p>
<p>
When you think about Antarctica what image comes to mind? Many think of the continent as being covered in snow topped mountains like the Swiss Alps.
The truth is much of the interior ice surface is flat and several kms (miles) thick. But the shape and elevation of the land under the ice surface is
extremely varied containing high mountains, deep valleys and sections of land that are deeper than ocean sea level. It is around the coastal edges of
Antarctica that the depressions and features under the ice are critically important.<hr>
<p>

<p>
<b>Why do we care about what is under the ice?</b> Scientists have been studying a series of important questions about the relationship between the ice, the land underneath, and the ocean around Antarctica. These include:
How much of the ice is resting on the land above sea level and how much is on land below sea level? How stable is the  <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding lines</a>?
How quickly can ice move from the land to the ocean? And is there a <a href="#crit" data-rel="popup">critical 'tipping point'</a>? The shape, depth, and overall character of the bed reveal many things about the history of the ice sheets.
We can learn about the ice sheet during previous glacial advances, by looking at the <a href="#depth" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> seaward of its present day ice limit,
when the ice sheet was larger extending further out than today.
Under the present day ice, where we find such recognizable terrestrial features as canyons, mountains, and terraces, lie clues to past interglacial
periods when there was much less ice in Antarctica than in present day.

<p>
<b>What features can we find hidden under the ice?</b> Underneath the seemingly tranquil ice that covers Antarctica lies a complex and varied terrain with <a href="#sub" data-rel="popup"> subglacial</a> mountain ranges including the Gamburtsev Mountains that are larger than the entire New York state, deep trenches and old river valleys cut into the coastal regions,
several hundred <a href="#sub" data-rel="popup"> subglacial</a> lakes throughout the continent including Lake Vostok the size of Lake Ontario, and in West Antarctica alone close to 150 volcanoes.
Some of these landscape features predate the ice cover on Antarctica, some 34 million years ago, but most of the landscape has been molded and altered by the glacial cycles.

Features that are formed by ice are termed 'glacio-morphological' with glacio referring to the ice and morphological referring to the
surface shape. The age of the Antarctic ice sheet means the land has been worked and reworked by the ice through time as it carves, drags and pulls over it, overprinting earlier landscape features.
The slow movement of thick ice carves deep U shaped features into the land as it moves. The influence of plate tectonics can also be seen in the Antarctic bedrock gouged like scars left behind from the
breakup of the <a href="#Gondwana" data-rel="popup"> Gondwana</a> supercontinent. In Antarctica where these deep trenches exist (like under Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers) they provide a way for
warming ocean water to move under the ice deep into the interior of the ice sheet, increasing ice melt. If the entire Antarctic ice sheet were to melt, it would be the equivalent of <a href="#metric" data-rel="popup">60 m</a> of sea level rise.

<p>
<b>Why is the Thwaites Region so important to study?</b> Although Antarctica is one continent it is made up of two different regions separated into West and East Antarctica by the Transantarctic Mountains.
West Antarctica, where we find the Antarctic Peninsula, is primarily an ice covered <a href="#archipelago" data-rel="popup">archipelago</a>. Ice in this area measures up to<a href="#metric1" data-rel="popup"> 2500 m</a> thick. You can use the app to explore what the surface is like when the ice is removed.
Some sections of land in West Antarctica are pushed down to as much as <a href="#metric2" data-rel="popup">2000 m</a> below sea level. The weight of the ice sheet pushes down on the crust to
make it sit lower than it would in an ice free world, increasing the area where rock is below sea level. West Antarctica holds the equivalent of<a href="#metric3" data-rel="popup"> 6 m</a> of sea level rise, with Thwaites glacier alone holding 2/3 of a meter.
East Antarctica is a much older and larger section of land. Ice in the East Antarctic interior measures up to <a href="#metric4" data-rel="popup">4100 m</a> thick and holds enough ice to raise sea level <a href="#metric5" data-rel="popup">55 m</a> considerably more than any other source on Earth.
The crust under East Antarctica is thicker than West Antarctica, and so the average elevation is higher, although parts still reach below sea level.

<p>
<b>What should we look for in the map?</b> On the map shown here the deep blue and purple colors show areas that are very deep, mostly off the continental shelf in the ocean collected from
shipborne multi-beam sonar. Cyan and light blue colors are areas on the continental shelf and relatively deep channels under the ice,
continuing inland from the <a href="#grounding" data-rel="popup">grounding lines</a>. Some of these inland channels reach over <a href="#metric6" data-rel="popup">2000 m</a> below sea level.
The yellow and red colors show the highest topography. These can be either large mountain ranges hidden for millions of years under several miles of ice, such as the Gamburtsev Mountains in the radar image below,
or a ridgeline of mountains exposed above the ice, such as the Trans Antarctic Mountains.
Notice that the deep channels in the bed align with fast flowing ice in the velocity map in the <b>Speed of ice flow map</b> in the App. <p>
</p>
<p>
<b>How can we use the app?</b> Areas <a href="#negative" data-rel="popup">below sea level</a> are easy to identify using the color scale in the app. For this exploration you may wish to to turn off the ITGC projects in
the upper left of the app in the options below the +/-. Click around in the app, what is the deepest location in the Thwaites catchment? Can you find a deep pathway for water to move from the coastline into the deep interior
of West Antarctica? What do you think might be the impact of ocean water moving in on this pathway?
Explore more broadly the Amundsen Sea region that also holds Pine Island and other neighboring glaciers.

If the ice sheet were to melt, these depressed areas of land would elevate slowly over thousands of years as the weight is removed and the crust rebounds.
Presently, this same type of rebound is occurring in other parts of the earth where ice has receded. It is most pronounced in the northern hemisphere in the Great Lakes and Canada's Hudson Bay regions and in Scandinavia,
where thousands of years have passed since they were covered by their own ice sheets, the Laurentide and Fennoscandia respectively.

<b>How was the data collected?</b> The map of the Antarctic bed is created using different methods/instruments that allowed imaging through the ice,
to determine the topography under the ice sheets, and imaging through the water to determine the <a href="#depth" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> under the ocean. Over the open ocean,
research vessels use multi-beam echo-sounders, a type of sonar, to map details around the edges and the continental shelf around the ice sheets.
For ice sitting on bedrock, radar can detect the bed measuring ice depth. Similar to the radar used in weather monitoring and in traffic enforcement,
electromagnetic energy is transmitted into the ice, and energy bounces back when it hits a reflective layer like the bed.
The distance to the reflecting surface can be calculated by knowing the speed of light in the ice and the signal delay.
However, liquid water is a poor conductor of this energy, thus where ice is floating the radar will move through the ice, but not travel through the water to detect the bedrock below.
Much of Antarctica's coastline includes extensive areas where the front edge of the ice sheet has gone afloat, called ice shelves. To map the area under these large blocks of attached ice is challenging as ship sonar can't do it and radar can't image through water.
Traditionally, gravity has been used. However, the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration has projects that include new methods for collecting depth measurements under the ice, a submarine style robot, a diving glider and even instrumented seals. Each new measurement will
give us new information about the <a href="#depth" data-rel="popup">bathymetry</a> under the ice shelf.

<b> Why are researchers interested in this data?</b> Researchers are focused on the shape and depths of bedrock underneath the ice sheet for many reasons.
As shown in the <b>Speed of Ice Flow</b> map in the App, ice flows downhill under its own weight and deeper channels cause faster ice flow.
The shape of the land under the ice determines how much interaction there is between the ocean, ice shelves and glaciers.
Where the bed under the ice sheet deepens inland from the grounding line the area is considered unstable, and is able to retreat rapidly inland.
Additionally, if there is more melt at the grounding line, than new ice being formed the ice sheet can retreat from its present day position.
